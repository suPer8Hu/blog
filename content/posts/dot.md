### Dot Language  
Dot language is a abstract grammar for defining Graphviz nodes, edges, graphs, subgraphs, and clusters.
`An edgeop is -> in directed graphs and -- in undirected graphs`.  
Semicolons and commas aid readability but are not required. Also, any amount of whitespace may be inserted between terminals.  
Below is a example dot file:
